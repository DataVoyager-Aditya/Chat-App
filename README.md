I developed a feature-rich chat application that enables users to communicate seamlessly in real time. Utilizing a tech stack that includes React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication, this project offers an engaging and responsive user experience. The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to create accounts, join chat rooms, and send messages instantly. By leveraging Socket.io, I implemented real-time message broadcasting, enabling users to receive messages without refreshing the page. This creates a smooth conversational flow that mimics real-life interactions. On the backend, I utilized Express.js to build a RESTful API that manages user authentication, message storage, and chat room functionalities. The application supports both public and private messaging, allowing users to engage in one-on-one chats or group discussions.
